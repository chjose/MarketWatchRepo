/*
 * Cool period:
 * if the price went up/down more than the desired percentage
 * within very short span of time like 1-2 mins, then we cannot conclude it as a market rally.
 * In these cases, we must wait for another few mins say 3 mins and find how the market is moving.
 * In this example the 3 mins is called as cool period. Buy/sell must be triggered only after the cool down period.
 * Else, chances of losses are high. 
 * If the stock price raises only gradually, ie 6-10 mins. Then we should not consider cool of period.
